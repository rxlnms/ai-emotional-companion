# Safety & Privacy

## Principles
- Opt-in only, camera off by default
- No hidden recording, no background monitoring
- No medical claims, no diagnosis
- User control: delete data anytime

## Data policy (MVP default)
- Store: aggregated numeric signals (optional)
- Do not store: raw video/audio frames

## Self-harm / crisis
If user expresses self-harm intent:
- Encourage contacting local emergency services / crisis hotlines
- Provide crisis resources
- Avoid instructions, avoid minimizing, keep supportive tone
