# Safety & Privacy (Web MVP)

## Principles
- Opt-in only: camera OFF by default
- No continuous monitoring, no background camera access
- No diagnosis, no medical or clinical claims
- User control: stop anytime, delete data anytime

## Data handling (default MVP)
- Do not store: raw video/audio frames
- Store (optional): aggregated numeric signals + timestamp + inferred label + confidence
- Explain clearly: what is collected, why, and how to delete it

## Language policy
Use cautious language:
- “possible signs of…”
- “may indicate…”
Avoid:
- “you have…”
- “you are depressed/anxious”
- “diagnosis/treatment”

## Crisis / self-harm handling
If user expresses intent to self-harm or is in immediate danger:
- Encourage contacting local emergency services immediately
- Provide crisis hotline resources (based on user country if known)
- Keep tone supportive, short, non-judgmental
- Do not provide instructions or detailed methods

## Consent copy (minimum)
- “Camera runs only during this session.”
- “We do not store raw video by default.”
- “You can stop anytime.”
- “This is not therapy or diagnosis.”
