# PRD — Emotional Mirror (MVP)

## Goal
Validate demand for an opt-in camera-based “emotional mirror” that helps users notice tension/stress and start reflection.

## Target users
- Students, expats, high-performers (18–30)
- People experiencing stress, burnout, emotional numbness

## Primary use case
User feels “fine” but senses something off → runs a 30s session → gets gentle feedback → chooses a reflection path.

## Success metrics
- D1 retention: user returns next day
- % users who try camera session at least once
- Session completion rate (30s)
- % users who continue into reflection prompts
- Qualitative: “this helped me notice something”

## MVP scope
In:
- Chat + opt-in camera session
- 3–4 emotional states output
- Reflection prompt flow (5–7 steps max)
Out:
- Diagnosis, therapy claims, continuous monitoring
- Complex emotion taxonomy, long-term analytics
